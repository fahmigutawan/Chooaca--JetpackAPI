Have you ever wonder to make an Android App with Weather API? But you don't know how to connect to "JSON-ish" API? So, here is the solution.

I want to introduce you to `Chooaca API`, a weather API that specifically developed to be a `Kotlin (Jetpack Compose) library`.   Right now, `Chooaca API` only available for `Kotlin Library (Especially Jetpack Compose)`, but we are wide open to be expanded into other developing environment.

# What Features Chooaca Offers to You?
